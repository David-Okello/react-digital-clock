## Code Overview

- `App.jsx`: Contains the main logic for the digital clock, including time updating and background image rotation. Utilizes React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- `DigitalClock.jsx`: Displays the current time in a digital format, dynamically updated based on state managed in `App.jsx`.
- `index.css`: Includes Tailwind CSS imports and custom styling for the project, enhancing the visual appeal of the digital clock.

## Usage of React Hooks

- `useState`: Used in `App.jsx` to manage state for background images, current index, next index, and opacity, allowing for dynamic rendering and updating of the clock.
- `useEffect`: Employed in `App.jsx` to handle side effects such as time updating and background image rotation. Ensures that these actions occur at the appropriate times and are cleaned up when necessary.
